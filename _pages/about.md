<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi！I am currently a doctoral student in CS at [the School of Advanced Interdisplinary Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://sais.ucas.ac.cn/index.php/zh/), and jointly trained at [CASIA](http://www.ia.cas.cn/), advised by Prof.Liang Wang, Prof.Shu Wu, and Prof.Li Qian. I achived my bachelor's degree of Big data management and application at [the Department of Information Science, Peking University](http://www.im.pku.edu.cn/), advised by Prof.Yi Bu. 

Holding the question of <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">“How can Artificial Intelligence help us make better use of information and do a better job”</span>, my research interest focuses on <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">the optimization and application of AI systems</span>, such as LLMs. I also have strong interest in Computer Vision, AI4S and Data-driven Science of Science.

Feel free to contact! (liuzb0129@outlook.com)

[Non-linearity between referencing behavior and citation impact: A large-scale, discipline-level analysis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2022.101318)

Jialin Liu, Hongkan Chen, **Zhibo Liu**, Yi Bu, Weiye Gu

- In this paper, we reveals **a non-linear relation between referencing behavior and citation impact of scientific publications**, using data of academic articles published in 2005 covered by Microsoft Academic Graph. Two types of patterns are observed, namely inverted-L and -U relations, both presenting the existence of critical points. We further explore the discipline-level differences of such a relationship and how it relates to the characteristics of the discipline itself.
